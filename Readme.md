# Build Live Score WebApp of Soccer Matches via API

26 November 2022



## Intro

When the [World Cup 2022 @Qatar](https://www.qatar2022.qa/) is in the Group stage, I decided to roll out this WebApp for web developers' eyes.

The 32 Teams of World Cup 2022 at Qatar are as table below:

| Group | Country 1       | Country 2           | Country 3           | Country 4            |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| A     | Qatar (QAT)     | Ecuador (ECU)       | Senegal (SEN)       | Netherlands (NED)    |
| B     | England (ENG)   | Iran (IRN)          | United States (USA) | Wales (WAL)          |
| C     | Argentina (ARG) | Saudia Arabia (KSA) | Mexico (MEX)        | Poland (POL)         |
| D     | France (FRA)    | Australia (AUS)     | Denmark (DEN)       | Tunisia (TUN)        |
| E     | Spain (ESP)     | Costa Rica (CRC)    | Germany (GER)       | Japan (LPN)          |
| F     | Belgium (BEL)   | Canada (CAN)        | Morocco (MAR)       | Croatia (CRO)        |
| G     | Brazil (BRA)    | Serbia (SRB)        | Switzerland (SUI)   | Cameroon (CMR)       |
| H     | Portugal (POR)  | Ghana (GHA)         | Uruguay (URU)       | Korea Republic (KOR) |

The content of this site is encouraged by a YouTube video, which I could not remember and find now. I would like to record my video later this year if condition allows.

Basically, this GitHub thread showcases how to build a complete Soccer Live Score WebApp using Django framework of Python.

Django Framework is a super powerful framework yet a simple framework that is capable of creating awesome web apps quickly.



## How to Get Started Quickly

1. Clone this GitHub site.

2. Install the Python libraries as below:

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch a terminal and run the Django Server:

   ```
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

   

## Notes
* You need some knowledge of Django framework, then Google it out please.

* This WebApp serves as a teaser since I am on the Free tier, and could not pull the World Cup 2022 info out of the API site.
* The preferred IDE is VS Code.
